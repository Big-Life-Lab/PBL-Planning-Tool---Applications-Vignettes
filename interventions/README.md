# Interventions

Scenarios allow you to ask what-if questions about the population, and see how that affects the outcome(s).

This folder contains all interventions that are available in the Planning Tool.

## Modifying interventions

If you'd like to create your own intervention, take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/pbl-planning-tool-documentation/wiki).
