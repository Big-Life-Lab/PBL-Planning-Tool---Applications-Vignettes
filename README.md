[The Project Big Life (PBL) Planning Tool](https://planning.projectbiglife.ca/) is an application for health professionals to use for health research and planning, as well as the development and evaluation of health interventions.

This repository contains two reference documents:

1) Vignettes - Case example how to use the planning tool. 
2) Interventions - a description of how interventions are defined and calculated

## [Vignettes](vignettes)

Included ase examples from the [PBL Planning Tool guide](https://big-life-lab.github.io/pbl-planning-tool-guide/caseexamples.html). We welcome contributions for additional vignettes or case examples. See the contributing section.

## [Interventions](interventions)

Included are intervention files that can be modified and loaded into the Planning Tool. This section provides the specific intervention thresholds for attribution calculations and calculation methods relative, absolute and target intervetion types. 

Currently, the intervention files can only be modified by the project team. That said, we welcome comments and hope to support the ability to create, save and use your own intervention method. 

### Contributing

We welcome contributions and questions. 

- The easiest way to propose a change or new feature is to file an [issue](https://github.com/Big-Life-Lab/pbl-planning-tool-documentation/issues). If you've found a
bug, you may also create an associated issue. If possible, try to illustrate your proposal or the bug with a minimal reproducible example.

- Do you have a strategy or intervention that you've created? Feel free to share your vignettes or case examples with others through this repository. We accept case examples through pull requests (PR). Please create a Git branch for each PR. [Click here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) for information on how to create a PR.

We accept examples that use analyses from any programming language. That stated, we support Open Science and recommend the use of open programming languages such as R, Python, and Julia.
