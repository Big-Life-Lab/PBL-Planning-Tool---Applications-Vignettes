[The Project Big Life (PBL) Planning Tool](https://planning.projectbiglife.ca/) is an application for health professionals to use for health research and planning, as well as the development and evaluation of health interventions.

This repository contains two reference documents:

1) Vignettes - Case example how to use the planning tool. 
2) Interventions - a description of how interventions are defined and calculated

## [Vignettes](vignettes)

Included ase examples from the [PBL Planning Tool guide](https://big-life-lab.github.io/pbl-planning-tool-guide/caseexamples.html). We welcome contributions for additional vignettes or case examples. See the contributing section.

## [Interventions](interventions)

Included are intervention files that can be modified and loaded into the Planning Tool. This section provides the specific intervention thresholds for attribution calculations and calculation methods relative, absolute and target intervetion types. 

Currently, the intervention files can only be modified by the project team. That said, we welcome comments and hope to support the ability to create, save and use your own intervention method.
