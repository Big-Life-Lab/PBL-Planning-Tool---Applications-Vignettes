# PBL Planning Tool Case Examples

The Project Big Life (PBL) Planning Tool (http://policy.projectbiglife.ca/) is an application for health professionals to use for health research and planning, as well as the development and evaluation of health interventions. 

As part of the PBL Planning Tool guidance (https://big-life-lab.github.io/PBL-Planning-Tool-Guidance/) there are case examples, which demonstrate how a user can use the PBL planning tool as part of their day-to-day operations. 

You can download this project onto your computer to work through the examples on your own.

This project contains:

and the Rcode for the case examples:
